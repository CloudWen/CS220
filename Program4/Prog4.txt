part1

	a. The outer loop of the row-oriented algorithm can not be parallelized, since there is a loop dependence. 

	b.The inner loop of the row-oriented algorithm can be parallelized, since there is no loop dependence.

	c. The (second) outer loop of the column-oriented algorithm can not be parallelized, since there is a loop dependence.

	d.  The inner loop of the column-oriented algorithm can be parallelized, since there is no loop dependence.
